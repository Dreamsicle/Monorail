# Monorail Pivot

## Welcome! 

This is the branch for a new, experimental version of Monorail. Compared to something like nginx or Apache, this is built to be more similar to [werc](http://werc.cat-v.org/) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

This might not be supported in the future, I'm just messing around. Tested on Node 6.9.1.

## Install

Clone the repo, do an `npm install`, get certs and modify `config.js` accordingly, and run `node index.js` from the working directory.
