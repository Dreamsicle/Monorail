## Welcome! 

This branch, and soon, repository, will be supporting a new webserver created from the ashes of labHTTP. It can currently take markdown files and convert them to a full blown website, similar to Jekyll, but there's an extensions system.

## Install

Clone the repo, do an `npm install`, get certs and modify `config.js` accordingly, and run `node index.js` from the working directory.
